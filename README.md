## Emotional Recognition

This project aims to develop an emotional recognition system using the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). The RAVDESS dataset contains 24 professional actors (12 male, 12 female)



## Model

### U-vector attention: [Attention Based Fully Convolutional Network forSpeech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01506)
- Used *0.3* lambda value
- Used Xavier Uniform Initialization

### CNN14 : [PANNs: Large-Scale Pretrained Audio Neural Networks for Audio Pattern Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10211.pdf)
- Used Average Pooling instead of Max Pooling
- Trained from various sources

### CNNX : [Shallow over Deep Neural Networks: A Empirical Analysis for Human Emotion Classification Using Audio Data](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-76736-5_13)
- Used a shallow net instead of deep net
- Used AVerage Pooling instead of Max Pooling
